# Visualization

To visualize the performance of pod with sidecar, we need to set up some toolchain components.

## Architecture

For visualization, this project uses the following components:

- Node Exporter: exports the resource consumption of the node host
- cAdvisor: exports the resource consumption of containers
- Prometheus Exporter: defines metrics, analyzes, calculates and exposes them
- Prometheus: pullsï¼Œstores and queries specific metrics
- Grafana: exports data and displays it as dynamic dashboard to monitor and analyzes real-time work status
- Jaeger: displays network request span through pipeline format

## Steps

For all machines, run commands following.

Note that, if you want to deploy your components on different machines, you need to specify the following environment values. And, you can also edit the corresponding part of [Makefile](Makefile) to modify port configuration. 

```shell
export LOCAL_IP=$(YOUR_LOCAL_IP)
export SIDECAR_IP=$(YOUR_SIDECAR_NODE_IP)
export VISUALIZE_IP=$(YOUR_VISUALIZATION_NODE_IP)

make pull
make deploy
```

To stop all, just run:

```shell
make stop
make rm
```

It will stop all containers and delete it, but not the images.
